# Appliance-Electricity-Consumption-Predictions



  Hello! This is a time series analysis on predicting appliance electricity usage from readings on temperature and humidity. The data was pulled from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/loveall/appliances-energy-prediction). I would recommend running the code in chunks based on the different categorize but if you run the full dataframe, it will take a while and will generate 47 plots.

  The data contains twenty-eight different variables with 19735 rows for intervals of ten minutes for 4.5 months. Different time series methods were utilized in this assessment such as Holt-Winter, multiple linear regression, ARMA, SARIMA, and base model building (average, drift, na√Øve, and simple exponential smoothing). Of all the methods applied, the model that had the most accurate predictive power was the multiple linear regression model.
